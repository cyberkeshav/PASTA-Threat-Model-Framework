<h1>PASTA Threat Model Framework For A New Shopping APP</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this activity, I was asked to review the following scenario and determine whether a new shopping app was safe to launch using PASTA (Process Of Attack Simulation And Threat Analysis) framework:

You’re part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. 

You are performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework. You will go through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.

Step 1: Identify the mobile app’s business objectives
Description: Our application should seamlessly connect sellers and shoppers. It should be easy for users to sign-up, log in, and manage their accounts. Data privacy is a big concern for us. We want users to feel confident that we’re being responsible with their information.

Buyers should be able to directly message sellers with questions. They should also have the ability to rate sellers to encourage good service. Sales should be clear and quick to process. Users should have several payment options for a smooth checkout process. Proper payment handling is really important because we want to avoid legal issues.

Step 2: Evaluate the apps components
The app will be exchanging and storing a lot of user data. These are some of the technologies that it will use:

- Application programming interface (API)
- Public key infrastructure (PKI)
- Advanced encryption system (AES)
- SHA-256
- SQL

Step 3: Review a data flow diagram

Step 4: Use an attacker mindset to analyze potential threats

Step 5: List vulnerabilities that can be exploited by those threats

Step 6: Map assets, threats, and vulnerabilities to an attack tree

Step 7: Identify new security controls that can reduce risk

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed activity: 
- 2-3 business objectives
- 2-3 technology requirements
- 2 potential threats
- 2 system vulnerabilities
- 4 defenses that limit risk
